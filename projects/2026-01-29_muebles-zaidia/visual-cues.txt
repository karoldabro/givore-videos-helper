# Visual Cues - Muebles Zaidia
# Date: 2026-01-29
# Duration: 60 seconds

---

## Visual Style
Style: WALKING
Reason: Rainy day, not cycling POV. Walking approach to the scene creates intimacy and builds mystery. Rain adds atmosphere and urgency.

---

## Lighting
Target: OVERCAST
Filming Time: Daytime (rainy/cloudy conditions)
Backup Plan: N/A - rain is part of the story, embrace the mood

---

## Item Category
Primary: FURNITURE
Share Potential: MEDIUM-HIGH
Key Visual Features: Wooden chairs with character, comodas with visible wood grain, tables showing solid construction. Contrast between quality furniture and rainy street = emotional impact.

---

## Pattern Interrupt (CRITICAL - addresses 0:02 dropoff)

| Timestamp | Interrupt Type | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1.5-2s | Quick zoom + rain SFX | 1.2x zoom on "no os lo vais a creer" + rain ambience boost |

**Recommended:** Quick zoom as the mystery hook lands. The rain sound creates natural atmosphere - boost it briefly as pattern interrupt.

## Timestamp Visual Cues

### HOOK (0-3s)
- Start with rain on camera/lens or wet street POV
- Walking in rain, mysterious mood
- DO NOT show furniture yet - build curiosity
- Text overlay possible: "Lo que me encontre..."

### PROOF TEASE (3-6s)
- "Quedaos hasta el final" - brief flash of furniture silhouette in rain? Or keep fully hidden
- Continue walking, approaching the scene from distance

### DISCOVERY (6-16s)
- Show person moving furniture to street
- Slow approach revealing items one by one
- Close-ups: wood grain on chairs, comoda drawers, table surface
- Rain drops on furniture = powerful visual contrast
- Each item gets 2-3 seconds of screen time

### PROBLEM (16-25s)
- "Esto se va a la basura hoy" - show items sitting in rain
- Wide shot: furniture on wet sidewalk, maybe near containers
- Rain creates urgency visually (items getting wet = time pressure)

### SOLUTION (25-40s)
- Show Givore app UI being opened
- Real phone in hand, rain visible
- "Foto, titulo, publico" - show actual posting process
- Screen recording of Givore upload if possible
- "Vecinos conectando" - brief map/location view

### IMPORTANCE/SHARING (40-50s)
- "Imaginad..." - could use split screen: furniture on street vs. in someone's home
- Or: text overlay with the sharing message

### CTA (50-60s)
- End with scenic rainy Valencia shot
- Text overlay: "Compartid" or Givore logo
- Calm ending, rain as backdrop

## POV Cycling Notes
- N/A - This is a WALKING video
- On foot approach creates more intimate feeling
- Consider: hand-held camera for authenticity

---

## Caption Styling
- Font: Sans-serif italic (Givore green)
- Color: #00AA00 or similar green
- Outline: 2-3px black (extra important with rain/overcast lighting)
- Position: Center, above bottom 20%
- Sync: Match speech timing exactly

---

## App Integration
- Show real Givore UI at: ~28-35s (solution section)
- Camera buttons visible: yes
- "In-the-moment" feel: filming in rain, phone slightly wet
- DO NOT stage fake demos

---

## Editor Notes
- Rain ambience audio: Layer subtle rain sounds throughout for atmosphere
- Speed: Normal pace, no rush - the rain mood works with contemplative energy
- Color grading: Slightly desaturated with warm wood tones popping - makes the furniture stand out against grey rain
- SFX: Gentle whoosh at item reveals, subtle pop when Givore app opens
- The contrast between rainy street and warm wooden furniture is the visual story
