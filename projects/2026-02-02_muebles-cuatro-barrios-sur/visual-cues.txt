# Visual Cues - Muebles Cuatro Barrios Sur
# Date: 2026-02-02
# Duration: ~60s

---

## Visual Style
Style: POV-CYCLING
Reason: Proven best performer (15.08s avg watch time). 4 barrios = movement-heavy, bike connects locations naturally.

---

## Lighting
Target: GOLDEN-HOUR
Filming Time: 15:00-17:00
Backup Plan: OVERCAST also works for these barrios (wide streets, good natural light)

---

## Item Category
Primary: MIXED (furniture + appliances)
Share Potential: MEDIUM-HIGH (functional items + variety keeps attention)
Key Visual Features: Variety of objects across neighborhoods - estanterias, microondas, sillas. Show each in its street context.

---

## Pattern Interrupt (CRITICAL - addresses 0:02 dropoff)

| Timestamp | Interrupt Type | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1.5-2s | Quick zoom + sound | 1.15x zoom on "lleva semanas pasando" + subtle whoosh SFX |
| 5s | Text flash | "4 BARRIOS" appears briefly as proof tease hits |

**Options chosen:**
- Quick zoom: 1.15x scale for 0.3s when "semanas pasando" lands
- Sound effect: Whoosh at 1.5s to lock attention
- Text flash: "4 BARRIOS" at proof tease to reinforce scale

## Timestamp Visual Cues

### HOOK (0-3s)
- POV cycling shot, constant motion through street
- Handlebars visible, movement feeling
- No items visible yet - pure mystery

### PROOF TEASE (3-5s)
- "Quedaos hasta el final..." - continue cycling
- Brief 0.5s flash-forward montage of items (optional: estanteria, microondas)
- Builds anticipation without full reveal

### DISCOVERY / NEIGHBORHOODS (5-16s)
- Cut between 4 barrio establishing shots while cycling
- Text overlay with each barrio name as mentioned:
  - "LA RAIOSA" (5-6s)
  - "FAVARA" (6-7s)
  - "EL HUERTO DE SENABRE" (7-8s)
  - "LA CRUZ CUBIERTA" (8-9s)
- Show items in each location: furniture on sidewalk, appliances visible
- Keep POV cycling perspective throughout

### PROBLEM (16-22s)
- Slow down cycling speed slightly for emotional weight
- Show items sitting alone on sidewalk - no one interacting
- "vive alguien que le vendria perfecto" - briefly pan to apartment buildings nearby
- Contrast: items on street vs. homes where they could be

### SOLUTION / APP (22-38s)
- "En Givore, la gente comparte..." - transition to app UI screen recording
- Show REAL Givore interface: feed with items published by users
- Quick demo: someone's post visible, location, photo
- "Lo suben, y cualquier vecino cerca lo ve" - show map/proximity feature
- Return to cycling shot: "Lo que yo encuentro en la calle son solo ejemplos..."
- Back to street items briefly

### PAYOFF (38-50s)
- "En la app, vecinos ya estan publicando..." - show app feed again
- Real posts from users: estanterias, microondas, sillas
- "disponibles para quien las necesite. Sin que lleguen a la acera" - contrast with street footage

### CTA (50-62s)
- Return to cycling shot for closing
- Scenic ending: keep pedaling through one of the barrios
- "Cada vez somos mas haciendolo" - show community growth visual (optional)
- End on pleasant cycling shot, no text overlay needed
- "Contadmelo abajo" - natural close

---

## POV Cycling Notes
- Bike handlebars visible: yes, throughout
- Motion maintained throughout: constant pedaling between barrios
- Discovery moment timing: 10-16s when items become visible
- IMPORTANT: Avoid stopping completely - slow down for item reveals but keep slight motion
- Route: La Raiosa -> Favara -> Huerto de Senabre -> Cruz Cubierta (all adjacent)

---

## Caption Styling
- Font: Sans-serif italic (Givore green)
- Color: #00AA00 or similar green
- Outline: 2-3px black
- Position: Center, above bottom 20%
- Sync: Match speech timing exactly
- Barrio names: Larger font, brief appearance (1s each)

---

## App Integration
- Show real Givore UI at: 22-28s (solution section) and 38-45s (payoff)
- Camera buttons visible: no (show existing posts, not posting flow)
- "In-the-moment" feel: transition from cycling to phone screen naturally
- DO NOT stage fake demos
- Focus on showing REAL user posts in the app feed
- Emphasize that items are shared BY users, not found on streets

---

## Editor Notes
- This video has 4 location transitions - use quick cuts, not dissolves
- Keep barrio name overlays consistent in style (same font, position, duration)
- Audio should feel continuous even across location cuts
- The message shift at ~28s ("Lo que yo encuentro en la calle son solo ejemplos") is KEY - slight pause in editing rhythm here
- App screen recordings should show genuine user posts, not staged content
- Total: ~62s at 200 WPM narration speed
