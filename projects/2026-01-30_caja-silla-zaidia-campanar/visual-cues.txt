# Date: 2026-01-30
# Duration: ~50 seconds

## Visual Style
Style: POV-CYCLING
Reason: Proven best performer (15.08s avg watch). Two neighborhoods = journey feel. Constant motion keeps attention.

---

## Lighting
Target: GOLDEN-HOUR
Filming Time: 15:00-17:00 (Valencia)
Backup Plan: Overcast works. If midday, add +5-10 warmth in post.

---

## Item Category
Primary: MIXED (caja de madera + silla de oficina azul)
Share Potential: MEDIUM-HIGH (the blue office chair is colorful, the wooden box has curiosity factor)
Key Visual Features: Blue chair stands out against street. Wooden box has texture/character.

## Pattern Interrupt (CRITICAL - addresses 0:02 dropoff)

| Timestamp | Interrupt Type | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1.5-2s | Quick zoom + pop SFX | 1.1x scale for 0.3s when "Dos hallazgos" lands. Pop SFX at 1.5s. |

---

## Timestamp Visual Cues

### HOOK (0-3s) - "Dos barrios. Dos hallazgos. Y uno de ellos..."
- POV cycling shot, motion, street visible
- Text overlay: "2 BARRIOS. 2 HALLAZGOS." large and bold
- Do NOT show items yet - keep mystery
- Pattern interrupt zoom at 1.5s on "hallazgos"

### DISCOVERY (3-10s) - "Hoy me he recorrido La Zaidia y Campanar..."
- Continue cycling footage
- Quick cuts showing both neighborhoods (1.5s per cut)
- Add whoosh SFX on each cut
- At ~8s: slow down approaching first item (caja de madera)
- At ~9s: reveal silla azul - brief slow motion (0.5x for 1s)

### PROBLEM (10-16s) - "Cosas brutales ahi tiradas... Que oportunidad perdida..."
- Wide shot showing items on sidewalk, people walking past
- Hold slightly longer (3-5s cuts)
- Subtle emotional tone - let the visual speak
- No fancy effects, just the reality of the scene

### RE-HOOK + SOLUTION (16-28s) - "Yo ya tengo un sistema... Lo dejo en Givore..."
- Cut to phone in hand, opening Givore app
- Show REAL app UI (camera interface, "Aceptar" buttons)
- Quick process: photo > title > publish
- Keep it natural, in-the-moment feel
- Speed up app interaction slightly (1.2x)
- Givore mention lands at ~20s (40% through) - good placement

### PAYOFF (28-38s) - "La silla azul... se la llevaron!"
- THIS IS THE KEY MOMENT
- Show notification/message from the person who took the chair
- Or show the empty spot where chair was
- Pop/ding SFX when "se la llevaron" hits
- Quick zoom (1.15x) on the reveal moment
- If possible: side-by-side of chair on street vs gone

### CTA/CLOSING (38-50s) - "Tenerla instalada merece la pena..."
- Return to cycling footage, scenic route
- Warm golden hour lighting
- Let the shot breathe (hold 5s+)
- No text overlay needed - voice carries the CTA
- End on beautiful Valencia street scene

---

## POV Cycling Notes
- Bike handlebars visible: YES (throughout)
- Motion maintained throughout: continuous except brief stops at items
- Discovery moment timing: viewer "discovers" items at ~8-9s with creator
- Speed up long cycling stretches to 1.3x

---

## Caption Styling
- Font: Sans-serif italic (Givore green)
- Color: #00AA00 or similar green
- Outline: 2-3px black
- Position: Center, above bottom 20%
- Sync: Match speech timing exactly

---

## App Integration
- Show real Givore UI at: ~20-25s (during solution section)
- Camera buttons visible: yes (natural capture)
- "In-the-moment" feel: film actual posting process
- DO NOT stage fake demos

---

## SFX Placement

| Timestamp | SFX | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| 1.5s | Pop | Pattern interrupt on hook |
| 3-10s | Whoosh (x3-4) | Discovery section cuts |
| ~9s | Ding | Item reveal (silla azul) |
| ~30s | Pop/Ding | "Se la llevaron!" payoff moment |
| ~38s | Subtle rise | Transition to CTA |

---

## Editor Notes
- The payoff (chair was taken) is the emotional climax - build to it
- The hook teases "ya tiene nuevo dueno" - the payoff delivers on this promise
- Keep La Zaidia and Campanar visually distinct (different street scenes)
- If available, show the Givore chat/notification proving someone claimed the chair
- Total pace: fast cuts in discovery (1-1.5s), longer holds in problem/payoff (3-5s)
