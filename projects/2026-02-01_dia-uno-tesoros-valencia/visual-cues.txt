# Visual Cues - Dia Uno Tesoros Valencia
# Date: 2026-02-01
# Duration: ~60 seconds

---

## Visual Style
Style: MIXED (cycling POV + app screen recording)
Reason: Combines proven POV cycling engagement with app social proof via screen recording of real user posts

---

## Lighting
Target: GOLDEN-HOUR preferred, but VARIED acceptable (multiple zones)
Filming Time: 15:00-17:00 for best results
Backup Plan: Overcast works; if midday, add +5-10 warmth in post

---

## Item Category
Primary: MIXED (estanteria found on street + various items from app screen recording)
Share Potential: MEDIUM-HIGH (variety + social proof of real users)
Key Visual Features: Contrast between "abandoned on street" vs "shared through app"

---

## Pattern Interrupt (CRITICAL - addresses 0:02 dropoff)

| Timestamp | Interrupt Type | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1.5-2s | Text flash + sound | "DIA 1" text pop with whoosh SFX as "bici" lands |

**Implementation:** At 1.5s mark, flash "DIA 1" in large bold text (Givore green) with pop/whoosh SFX. Duration: 0.4s. This reinforces the serialized format and creates visual punch.

## Timestamp Visual Cues

### HOOK (0:00-0:12) - "Day X" serialized format
- 0:00-0:03: POV cycling shot, movement, urban scenery
- Text overlay: "DIA 1" (large, bold, Givore green) - stays on screen
- 0:03-0:06: Continue cycling, camera looking forward
- 0:06-0:08: "A ver que encontramos" - slight camera pan/look around
- 0:08-0:12: Approach to estanteria, slow down cycling
- Pattern interrupt at 1.5-2s: zoom 1.1x + whoosh SFX

### DISCOVERY (0:12-0:20)
- 0:12-0:14: Close-up of estanteria on sidewalk. Slow motion 0.5x for reveal
- Pop/ding SFX on "estanteria"
- 0:14-0:16: Detail shots (shelves, condition, surroundings)
- 0:16-0:20: Quick cut showing the estanteria is "abandoned" - context shot

### PROBLEM (0:20-0:27) - "Could have been shared" angle
- 0:20-0:22: Transition shot - cycling away from estanteria
- 0:22-0:27: Reflective shot (movement, streets, passing by things)
- Keep motion constant - don't stop
- Tone: contemplative, not judgmental

### SOLUTION + SOCIAL PROOF (0:27-0:40) - APP SCREEN RECORDING
- 0:27-0:30: Transition to phone screen recording
- 0:30-0:36: Show REAL posts from Givore app - scroll through items people shared
- Highlight: muebles, ropa, objetos visible in app feed
- 0:36-0:40: Show YOUR upload process - quick demo (foto, nombre, listo)
- Keep screen recording clean, not too fast

### APP DEMO (0:40-0:45)
- Quick cut back to cycling or phone
- Show the upload moment: photo → title → publish
- Result visible: "Alguien cerca lo ve y se lo lleva"

### CTA + CLOSING (0:45-0:60)
- 0:45-0:50: Back to cycling POV, scenic street shot
- 0:50-0:55: Text overlay: "DIA 1" (callback to serialized format)
- 0:55-0:60: Scenic ending shot while CTA plays
- Optional: Text overlay with "?" to prompt comments

---

## POV Cycling Notes
- Bike handlebars visible: yes (at least in opening and closing)
- Motion maintained: throughout cycling sections, pause only for item reveal
- Discovery moment: 0:12 - viewer sees estanteria as creator slows down

---

## Caption Styling
- Font: Sans-serif italic (Givore green)
- Color: #00AA00 or similar green
- Outline: 2-3px black
- Position: Center, above bottom 20%
- Sync: Match speech timing exactly
- Special: "DIA 1" text larger/bolder than regular captions

---

## App Integration
- Show real Givore UI at: 0:27-0:40 (screen recording of feed + upload)
- Camera buttons visible: yes during upload demo
- "In-the-moment" feel: screen recording should feel like scrolling casually
- DO NOT stage fake demos - use real app data

---

## Editor Notes
- This is a SERIES PILOT - "Dia 1" branding should be consistent for future episodes
- Consider a small "DIA 1" watermark in corner throughout (optional)
- The screen recording section (0:27-0:40) is the unique element - make it feel organic, not like an ad
- Speed up cycling footage to 1.2x for energy
- Slow motion 0.5x for estanteria reveal only
- SFX: whoosh at 1.5s, pop at estanteria reveal, subtle rise before CTA
- Music: upbeat but not overwhelming, duck under voice, fade for CTA
