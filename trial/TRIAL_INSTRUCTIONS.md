# Givore Trial Content System

Master reference for experimental TikTok/Instagram Reels scripts.

## What is Trial Content?

Trial content is **experimental short-form video** that targets specific audiences with specific problems -- people who have things they want to get rid of. Unlike street-finds content (where the creator discovers items), trial content speaks directly to **potential givers**: people renovating, moving, decluttering, or sitting on items they no longer use.

**The key difference:**
- **Street-finds** (regular content): "Look what I found" → Givore connects finders and givers
- **Trial content**: "Do YOU have stuff you don't need?" → Givore helps you share it

## Core Principles

### 1. Make Them Feel Seen

The viewer should feel like the video was made specifically for THEM. Specificity creates recognition. "That painting you've had in storage for 3 years" hits harder than "stuff you don't use."

### 2. Never Lecture

Trial content entertains, provokes, or creates recognition. It does NOT educate about sustainability or preach about waste. The message is implicit.

### 3. Humor Comes From Truth

When using humoristic or sarcastic tones, the comedy comes from **recognizable situations**, not from trying to be funny. Forced humor damages authenticity.

### 4. Indirect Marketing Wins

The most effective trial content never mentions Givore. The viewer discovers the app through curiosity (visiting the profile) not through being told to download it.

### 5. Questions Over Statements

Questions make viewers pause and self-reflect. "Do you have a chair that hasn't been sat on in 2 years?" is more engaging than "Many people have unused furniture."

### 6. Viewer as Ally (Inherited)

The same tone guardrails from street-finds apply: the viewer is your ALLY, not the problem. Never guilt-trip, blame, or make them feel bad about having stuff. The goal is to make sharing feel easy and natural.

## How Trial Differs from Street-Finds

| Aspect | Street-Finds | Trial |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Narrative** | "I found something" | "Do you have something?" |
| **Visual** | Cycling/walking, showing items | Same cycling/walking POV, different narration |
| **Target** | General audience (finders) | Specific audience segments (givers) |
| **Tone options** | educational, exciting, community, emotional | humoristic, empathetic, provocative, dramatic, relatable, sarcastic |
| **Script structure** | Fixed 8-section format | 5 flexible format templates |
| **Marketing** | Always mentions Givore | Can be indirect (no mention), soft, or direct |
| **Duration** | 30-120s | 15-60s (shorter, punchier) |
| **CTA focus** | Download/engagement/community | Profile visit/engagement/save/share |
| **Location** | Specific Valencia barrio | Not location-dependent |

## Content Strategy: When to Use Trial vs Street-Finds

### Use Trial When:
- Testing new audience segments
- Creating shareable/relatable content
- Building brand awareness without product mention
- Growing followers through entertainment value
- Experimenting with humor and different tones
- Targeting the "giver" side of the marketplace

### Use Street-Finds When:
- Demonstrating the app in action
- Showing real finds and real value
- Building the "treasure hunting" narrative
- Creating location-specific content
- Educating about social recycling

### Ideal Mix:
- 60-70% street-finds (core content)
- 30-40% trial (audience growth and experimentation)

## Visual Format for Trial Content

Trial reels use the **same visual format** as street-finds (cycling/walking POV through Valencia) but with narration targeting the giver audience. The creator rides through the city while delivering the trial script -- the visual movement keeps engagement high while the narration targets specific audience pain points.

**Visual notes:**
- POV cycling remains the proven best performer
- Text overlays are critical (40-85% watch without sound)
- Pattern interrupt at 1.5-2s still applies
- Golden hour (15:00-17:00) still the target
