# Trial Marketing Approach Matrix

Decision framework for choosing between INDIRECT, SOFT, and DIRECT marketing approaches in trial content.

---

## Three Approaches

### INDIRECT (No mention of Givore)

**What it means:** The video addresses the pain point and ends without offering a solution. The brand presence is ONLY in the profile, not in the content.

**Givore mention:** Zero. Not even subtle. Not even as a text overlay.

**Why it works:**
- Algorithm rewards content people share, save, and watch through -- not content that drives clicks away
- Viewers who relate will visit the profile out of curiosity
- No commercial feel = higher trust = higher engagement
- Best for testing which audiences respond

**Best tones:** Humoristic, Sarcastic, Provocative

**Best formats:** Question Barrage, Humor Skit, Problem Escalation

**CTA types:** ENGAGEMENT, FOLLOW, SHARE

**Profile strategy:** Bio and profile must clearly state what Givore is, because curious viewers will check after watching indirect content.

**Example flow:**
```
Funny video about clutter → viewer relates → watches to end →
visits profile → sees "Givore - Reciclaje social" → curious →
follows or downloads
```

### SOFT (Mention at the very end)

**What it means:** 90% of the video is problem/recognition-focused. The last 3-5 seconds mention Givore naturally -- as a name, a text overlay, or a brief one-liner.

**Givore mention:** Name only. No demo. No detailed explanation.

**Why it works:**
- The content earns attention first, then plants the seed
- Viewers who already relate are more receptive to the mention
- Feels like a natural conclusion, not a sales pitch
- Works as a bridge between pure awareness and conversion

**Best tones:** Relatable, Empathetic, Humoristic

**Best formats:** Scenario Story, Direct Address, Question Barrage

**CTA types:** SAVE, PROFILE-VISIT, SHARE

**Transition patterns (from content to Givore):**
- "Por cierto, existe una app para esto." (text overlay at end)
- "Alguien debería inventar algo para esto... ah, espera." (comedic)
- "Pues hay gente que ya lo hace." (then show Givore name)
- "Hay quien lo resuelve en veinte segundos." (curiosity)
- "Givore." (just the name, last frame)

---

### DIRECT (Givore as the solution)

**What it means:** Problem takes the first 50-60% of the video, then Givore is presented as the solution. Similar to street-finds structure but from the GIVER perspective.

**Givore mention:** Name + brief explanation of how it works from the GIVER perspective (not finder).

**Why it works:**
- Clear problem-solution narrative is satisfying
- Works for retargeting warm audiences who already know the brand
- Tutorial-adjacent content has high save rates
- Directly shows the value proposition

**Best tones:** Empathetic, Relatable, Dramatic

**Best formats:** Direct Address, Scenario Story

**CTA types:** DOWNLOAD, SAVE, AWARENESS

**Givore integration from GIVER perspective:**
- "Givore. Foto, título, publicar. Ya está visible para quien lo necesite."
- "Abres Givore, subes lo que ya no usas, y alguien cerca lo encuentra."
- "En vez de tirarlo... lo compartes. Veinte segundos."
- "No tienes que venderlo. Solo compartir."

## Decision Matrix: When to Use Each

### By Audience Temperature

| Audience Temperature | Recommended Approach | Reasoning |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Cold** (never heard of Givore) | INDIRECT | Build awareness through entertainment first |
| **Warming** (seen a few videos) | SOFT | Plant the seed without pushing |
| **Warm** (engaged before) | DIRECT | They're ready for the value proposition |

### By Tone

| Tone | INDIRECT | SOFT | DIRECT |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| HUMORISTIC | ++ | + | - |
| EMPATHETIC | + | ++ | ++ |
| PROVOCATIVE | ++ | - | - |
| DRAMATIC | + | + | + |
| RELATABLE | ++ | ++ | + |
| SARCASTIC | ++ | - | - |

`++` = ideal | `+` = works | `-` = avoid

### By Format

| Format | INDIRECT | SOFT | DIRECT |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| QUESTION BARRAGE | ++ | ++ | + |
| SCENARIO STORY | ++ | ++ | ++ |
| PROBLEM ESCALATION | ++ | + | + |
| DIRECT ADDRESS | + | ++ | ++ |
| HUMOR SKIT | ++ | + | - |

### Key Rule: Humor + Direct = Avoid

When the tone is primarily comedic (HUMORISTIC, SARCASTIC), avoid DIRECT marketing. Comedy dies when it becomes an ad. Use INDIRECT or at most SOFT for humorous content.

## Content Sequencing Strategy

For a new audience segment, follow this progression:

```
Week 1-2: INDIRECT (3-4 videos)
  → Build recognition, test what resonates
  → Track: engagement rate, profile visits

Week 3-4: SOFT (2-3 videos)
  → Plant the Givore seed
  → Track: profile visits, follows

Week 5+: DIRECT (1-2 videos)
  → Convert warm audience
  → Track: downloads, saves

Ongoing: Mix 60% INDIRECT + 30% SOFT + 10% DIRECT
```

## Approach by Audience Segment

| Audience | Starting Approach | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| RENOVATING | SOFT or DIRECT | High intent -- they NEED to get rid of stuff NOW |
| NEW-HOUSE | SOFT | Moderate intent -- dealing with transition |
| OLD-ITEMS | INDIRECT | Low urgency -- need to create awareness |
| MOVING | DIRECT | Urgent need -- they need a solution TODAY |
| CLUTTER | INDIRECT | Entertainment-first -- build the habit of watching |
| SEASONAL | INDIRECT | Low urgency -- relatable content first |

## Hashtag Strategy by Approach

### INDIRECT (no brand hashtags)
Focus on audience-relevant hashtags:
- RENOVATING: #reforma #reformas #obrasencasa #antesydespues
- NEW-HOUSE: #casamueva #mudanza #decoracion #hogar
- OLD-ITEMS: #declutter #minimalism #orden #organizar
- MOVING: #mudanza #mudarme #cambio #nuevaetapa
- CLUTTER: #orden #konmari #minimalistaespañol #limpiar
- SEASONAL: #cambiodetemporada #primavera #otoño #armariolimpio

### SOFT (subtle brand inclusion)
Same as INDIRECT + add:
- #givore (at the end of hashtag list)

### DIRECT (brand present)
Same as INDIRECT + add:
- #givore #reciclaje #reciclajesocial #darencontrar #segundavida
